# What is Unreal Live Link for Maya?

Unreal Live Link for Maya is a project to create a Maya plugin that speeds your animation workflow as you no longer need to export your content and import it into Unreal Engine to see how it looks. You can now work directly inside Maya, and through Live Link, preview what it will look like inside the Engine in real-time.
